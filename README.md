# Ricardo-Interest
For Coursera class project.

I am learning to code seriously this time around and this is dev will be for a class project taken through Coursera Programming foundations with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

The Ricardo-Interest is self explanitory. I will be creating a web page about myself and explaining my interest to others. With many iterations (ha ha I have been waithing to utilize that word) the page will get better as my knowledge and experience grows. 

Follow if you began to like what you see and give me suggestions; all criticism welcome..... However if at possible be tactful about it ;)
